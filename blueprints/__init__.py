# Python defines two types of packages, regular packages and namespace packages.
# Regular packages are traditional packages as they existed in Python 3.2 and earlier.
# A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file. 
# When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the
# objects it defines are bound to names in the packageâ€™s namespace. The __init__.py file can 
# contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some
# additional attributes to the module when it is imported.
# The presented is the python documenation on regular packages in regards to this __init__.py file
